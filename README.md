# Interactive Visualization and Validation Techniques for Algorithmic Decision Making
> Outcome-Explorer and SliceTeller Approaches

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and findings of a seminar conducted on Visual Computing, focusing on the development of the Outcome-Explorer and SliceTeller tools. These tools are designed to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of algorithmic decision-making systems through interactive and visual means, catering to both expert and non-expert users.

## Outcome-Explorer
Outcome-Explorer is a causality-guided interactive interface that utilizes Pearl's Structural Causal Model (SCM) to define causal relationships in a model, making it intrinsically interpretable.

## SliceTeller
SliceTeller is a tool for debugging, comparing, and improving machine learning models using critical data slices. It includes features like automatic identification of problematic slices, and a novel algorithm, SliceBoosting, for optimizing performance on these slices.

## Formative Studies
Included are the details of formative studies conducted with non-expert users to gauge their expectations from decision-making interfaces, focusing on the need for transparency and efficiency.

## System Workflow and Module Design
The repository elaborates on the system workflow of both tools and their module designs, aiming to support users in creating, interpreting, and improving predictive causal models.

## Usage
Please refer to individual directories for detailed instructions on using the Outcome-Explorer and SliceTeller tools.

## Collaborations and Acknowledgements
The seminar and the subsequent development of these tools were carried out in collaboration with MLOps engineers and various experts in the field of Visual Computing.
